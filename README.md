GLLIB (GL Library)
==========

About
----------
GLLIB at the moment contains only header files that can be used as an abstraction layer for OpenGL to speed up developments time.  The files are currently a mixture of C and C++ code.  The goal for this project is to develop a detailed library for rendering, physics, data management, etc. written in C so that it can be used on all platforms including iOS development.

Note from the Author
---
This library is a C/OpenGL take on an older engine I created in Java in an effort to move forward in my own programmatic abilities and hopefully make a contribution to the Open Source community all at the same time.
